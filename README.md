Source code of mobile games developed in Unity3D and C# and launched on the Android and iOS platforms in the early 2015. 

ShadeShift and 245 were two mobile games released in the early and mid 2015. The games have run their course and were downloaded by over 50,000 users at their peak. We can now make the source code available to users and first time game developers to adopt, review and learn. Happy Learning!

The scripts for the games can be found in the Assets folder which basically control all the animations, sprites, audio and pop ups which build the mobile gaming experience. 

Android and iOS platform specific packages can be found in plugins under assets.
