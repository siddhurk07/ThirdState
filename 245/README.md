245 was cross platform mobile game released in the mid 2015. I believe that the game has run its course and was downloaded by over 50,000 users. We can now make the source code available to users and first time game developers to adopt, review and learn. Happy Learning!

The scripts for the project can be found in the Assets folder which basically control all the animations, sprites, audio and pop ups which build the mobile gaming experience.

Android and iOS platform specific packages can be found in plugins under assets.
